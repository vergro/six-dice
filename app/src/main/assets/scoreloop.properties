# here. By default, every game has one mode. To add more modes, modify the 
# game.mode.max. Note that the maximum is not inclusive, (i.e. min=0, max=3
# defines modes 0, 1, and 2).

# In order to sort local scores, you have to provide a score comparator. 
# Possible values are ascending or descending (the default)

# from the AndroidManifest.xml
